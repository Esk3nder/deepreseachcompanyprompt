TITLE: Crypto×AI Company “Batman File” Dossier — Investor × VC × Product Research

ROLE & OBJECTIVE
• You are a capable reasoning-grade model.
• Objective: Produce a thorough, decision-ready dossier (“Batman file”) on a target Crypto×AI company, suitable for an investor/VC/product researcher: facts, context, risks, on-chain, founders, tech, traction, and catalysts — all tightly cited.

TARGET COMPANY
• https://www.dawninternet.com/

CONTEXT
• RAW_TASK: Investigate a single target company operating at the crypto × AI intersection and deliver the most complete public-info dossier feasible.
• ASSETS: Any documents/links supplied by the user (treat as high-priority sources).
• HISTORY: The audience expects rigorous structure, auditable citations, and actionable outputs.

ASSUMPTIONS (used only if inputs are incomplete)
• Company identity = most likely entity matching the query (name, ticker, URL, token symbol). Prefer official website, docs, and verified socials.
• If token exists: primary chains = Ethereum/Base/Solana unless strong evidence suggests otherwise.
• If certain data are unavailable (e.g., private revenue), provide estimates with transparent methods and uncertainty bands.

CLARIFY-FIRST (ask 1 focused Q at a time; stop once resolved)
1) “Can you confirm the exact company (official homepage or verified social)?” If absent, proceed with best match and log assumption(s).

CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS
• No chain-of-thought disclosure; provide concise rationales only.
• Cite every non-obvious claim with source, URL, and access date; prefer primary/official sources.
• Respect privacy: include only public professional details; do not doxx private addresses.
• Token budget for final answer ≤ 3,500 tokens (trim appendices if needed).
• Style: professional, concise, skimmable; tables where helpful.
• Runtime hints: reasoning_effort=high, verbosity=med.

METHOD (Reasoning Drivers)
• Strategy: Retrieval-Augmented + Plan-Then-Solve with light Self-Consistency checks.
• Retrieval: Prioritize official site/docs, GitHub, whitepapers, audits, block explorers (Etherscan, BaseScan, SolanaFM), Token Terminal/DeFiLlama/L2Beat/Messari/CoinGecko (open sources), X/Twitter, Farcaster, LinkedIn, YouTube, Mirror/Medium, Discord/Telegram (public), reputable news (press/announcements), academic or security research.
• Meta-Prompting Loop:
  – Micro-upgrades: (1) tighten source hierarchy, (2) collapse duplicative sections, (3) flag uncertainties early.
  – Probe: list key unknowns (revenue, unit economics, custody, audits).
  – Capability discovery: if paywalled source, find open substitute.
  – Socratic why: justify chosen sources vs alternatives when ambiguity exists.
• Agentic Eagerness Controls:
  <context_gathering>
  Goal: confirm company identity, token/chain(s), and official links; gather enough to reach ~70% completeness.
  Budget: ≤ 25 retrieval calls (favor breadth then depth).
  Escape: proceed under logged assumptions if identity is sufficiently clear.
  </context_gathering>
• Tool Preambles (for each tool use):
  1) Rephrase micro-goal, 2) Plan sub-steps, 3) Note progress, 4) State “what changed vs plan.”

EXECUTION STEPS
1) Restate task in one line (company, token, chains, confirmed handles).
2) Plan minimal section order (below) with target outputs.
3) Execute retrieval; extract facts; build tables; compute simple metrics; collect wallets/contracts.
4) Validate: cross-check founder identities, token details, audits, dates; reconcile conflicting claims; mark unresolved items.
5) Calibrate: report confidence ∈ [0,1] and top uncertainties.

OUTPUT SPEC (produce ALL sections below; collapse any that are N/A)
0) Cover Card (one-screen summary)
   – Company • One-liner • Status (pre/seed/series/public) • HQ/Geo • Founded (year) • Employees (est.) • Token (if any) • Chains • Website • Docs • Pitch (140 chars)
1) Executive Summary (≤ 250 words)
   – What they do, why it matters, stage, traction snapshot, thesis in 3 bullets, top risks in 3 bullets.
2) Snapshot Table
   – Name | Legal entity | Founded | Founders (names/roles) | Team size (est) | HQ/remote | Verticals | Business model | Monetization | Token? (Y/N) | Chain(s) | Custody/infra | Audits | Key partners | Current round & investors | Runway (est) | Links (site/docs/GitHub/X/Farcaster/LinkedIn/YouTube/Discord/Telegram/Mirror)
3) Founders & Key Team (“People file”)
   – Per founder: bio (2–3 lines), prior wins, domain expertise, notable publications/repos, verified socials, public wallets (if they self-disclosed), reputation flags (awards/controversies) with citations.
4) Product & Tech Teardown
   – Product overview & modules • User personas & JTBD • Onboarding/UX notes.
   – AI stack: models used (proprietary vs OSS), finetuning, evals, guardrails, inference infra (GPU vendor, cloud), data sources/provenance/licensing, latency/throughput claims.
   – Crypto stack: contracts, on-chain architecture, custody, oracle usage, rollup/L2 choice rationale, cross-chain bridges.
   – Security posture: audits (firms, dates), bug bounty, incident history, mitigations.
   – Diagrams: simple ASCII/block diagrams for system & data flow.
5) Market, Category, and Landscape
   – Market definition; TAM/SAM/SOM (estimates + method).
   – Competitive set: direct, adjacent, substitutes; a 2×2 map and a comparison table (features, pricing, traction, moats).
   – Ecosystem position: partners, upstream/downstream dependencies.
6) Traction & Metrics (publicly inferable)
   – Users/MAU, revenue (est), growth rates, retention proxies, notable logos.
   – On-chain KPIs: TVL, active wallets, tx volume, fee revenue, incentive emissions, contract interactions (tables with time horizons).
7) Business Model & Unit Economics
   – Pricing, gross margin drivers, LTV/CAC assumptions, major cost centers (compute, validators, custody, audits), scalability constraints.
8) Token & On-Chain (omit if no token)
   – Token symbol • Standard • Supply schedule • Emissions • Treasury • Utility vs governance • Vesting • Liquidity & market venues.
   – Governance design, voting history, delegates.
   – Contract addresses (core/token/timelock/treasury), top holders (public), notable transactions.
9) Regulation, Compliance, & Legal
   – Jurisdictions, licensing/custody posture, privacy/data handling, IP (patents/licenses), disclosed legal matters.
10) Moats & Strategy
   – SWOT, 7 Powers (Hamilton Helmer), Porter’s Five Forces; distribution strategy; founder-market fit; defensibility.
11) Risks & Red Flags (ranked)
   – Technical, security, economic, regulatory, team, execution; each with mitigation direction.
12) Catalysts & Watchlist
   – Upcoming releases, audits, listings, partnerships, governance votes, conference moments; calendar table (date|event|why it matters).
13) Investment Memo Slice
   – Bull/Base/Bear cases (3 bullets each), key diligence Qs for founder meeting, doc request list.
14) Appendices
   – A) Timeline (dated milestones) • B) Source log • C) Method notes • D) Glossary.

CITATION STANDARD
• Every material fact gets [#] with: Source Name — “Title” — URL — Published (or updated) date — Accessed YYYY-MM-DD.
• For tables/metrics, add a “Sources” row listing refs. If using aggregated dashboards (e.g., DeFiLlama), capture the exact view/filters.

SOURCE PRIORITY (descending)
1) Official (site/docs/GitHub/contracts/audits) → 2) First-party socials & talks → 3) Block explorers/on-chain analytics → 4) High-quality research/news → 5) Aggregators (DeFiLlama, TokenTerminal, CoinGecko, L2Beat, Messari) → 6) Community w/ caution.

DATA ETHICS & PRIVACY
• Only public professional details; no scraping of private/personal data; don’t publish non-self-disclosed personal wallets.

• Contract addresses verified on explorers; audit dates/firms match PDFs/posts.
• Dates in timeline ordered and sourced; token metrics reconcile with explorers/docs.
• Clearly mark estimates and uncertainties.

DELIVERABLE FORMAT
• One comprehensive Markdown report with the sections above, interleaving concise tables/diagrams, followed by the JSON summary blob and a numbered citation list.

FINAL BLOCK
• End with: Confidence (0–1), Uncertainties (bullets), and the 3 most decision-relevant open questions.
